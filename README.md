# Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI)

The **Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI)** was designed and tested to work with RGB sensors.
VARI is a **measure of “how green”** an image is. VARI is not intended as a substitute for an NIR camera,
but it is meaningful when working with non-NDVI imagery. RGB images with the VARI algorithm applied
make it **possible to detect areas of crop stress in a field.**


## Purpose

As the Earth's population is increasing and the demand of food is increasing, it is  
important to equip farmers with the state of the art technology in order to pull this off.
I wrote this script to show how simple it can be to analyze field health.
